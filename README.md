# USING-GENERALIZED-LINEAR-MODEL-TO-PREDICT-STOCK-PERFORMANCE

Based on the the QQ plot and R square, it indicate the model is good fit. However, using multiple liner regression we got around 25% error rate, and by using logistic regression, we get around 46% error rate, meaning using Generalized linear model to analyze stock trend is not accurate enough.
From 2015 to 2020, the daily average rise and fall of the stock was around -0.23% to 0.18%, The average day trades without any profit or loss. In addition, a chart of the total number of daily gains and losses from 2015 to 2020 shows that short-term investing in this stock is not an ideal strategy. By using the method of logistic regression analysis, we predict that the opening price of this stock is likely to show a downward trend every day, but the difference is not obvious. So this stock is not suitable for daily trading operations.
The stock has made very good returns in 2016(more than 52% yearly return) and 2019 - 2020(more than 30% yearly return). It is on a long-term uptrend. Although the yearly returns sheet indicate the average returns between 2013-2020 only 4%. But based on its long-term performance, we can tell that it is suitable for long-term holding. I would finally include this stock in my investment portfolio due to a low-risk, low-return strategy that can be used to balance my investment allocation risk.
